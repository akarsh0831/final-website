      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="./images/portrait2.jpg" alt="Portrait">
      <p>I am a young, trustworthy, dependable and compassionate professional currently working full-time at Amazon while studying business management and software engineering alongside my job. Additionally, I am a team player with an eye for pinpointing areas that will improve the overall customer experience. I strive to be a meticulous problem solver, willing and able to work independently, ready to fulfill an integral role within a team or lead when necessary. When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy quality time with friends and family, working out, watching TV, and taking part in stress-relieving activities such as meditating.
